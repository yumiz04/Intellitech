## How does it work?
### Installation
1. Navigate to your workspace:
> Note: I personally use the directory *Documents/tec/S5/BD*, but the one you use will be different. My command would look like:
```
cd Documents/tec/S5/BD
```
> And your command will be the path where you want to work, for example:
```
cd Documents/DB
```
2. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yumiz04/Intellitech.git
```
### Usage
#### Prerequisites
- Have MongoDB installed locally.
- Have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed.
- Have the MongoDB extension for VS Code installed.
#### Steps
1. Navigate to the Intellitech directory:
```
cd Intellitech
```
2. Open a shell and type:
```
code .
```
    to open VS Code in that directory.
3. Go to the MongoDB section on the left side of VS Code and start a local connection.
4. Open the files in the following order:
- Schema creation file.
- Data insertion file.
- Query file.
- Deletion file (if you want to delete the created schema).
And thatâ€™s it! You should now be ready to work with the Intellitech-Retail database in MongoDB.
